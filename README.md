# ball-and-beam
Ardino code for control of beam and ball system.

Some adjustments were made for the platform used. In the platform, the servo motor had a range of 0 to 60 ◦ centered in 80 ◦.

The range of movement of the servomotor was set to 0 to 60◦, centered in 80◦ with the beam horizontal. This limits the range of the motor for an angle of ±30◦. With this range of
angular movement, it is possible to move the beam to center the ball at the desired position.
